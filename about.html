                        High levels of household moisture can cause mold, a serious health hazard that can often require considerable work to correct. Excessive moisture may also attract rodents and insects into the home. No one wants to deal with that! Watch windows for condensation. That can be a clue that there’s too much humidity in the house.

            <dd>
                Vacuuming your floor every week or at least every other week will help eliminate dust, fur dander and dirt. Regular cleaning will extend the life of your floor may it be carpet, laminated, hardwood, or other materials, which help improve the air quality in your home.

                Clogged dryer ducts and vents can cause fires. It's important to clean the vent every year and replace old accordion-style interior dryer ducts with a straight metal duct. The folds in the old-style vents collect lint until the buildup becomes hazardous. Once the ducts are cleaned, your dryer will operate more efficiently also. <br>

                Having a ceiling fan can help keep the air in your room circulated and possibly lower energy costs. Make sure fan blades are clean, so you don't end up breathing in the dust that collects on the fan. The bathroom fan reduces the moisture accumulation in your bathroom, and it is more efficient and effective when it's clean and besides, it looks nicer too!

                            The last thing you want is water damage which can be an expensive and time-consuming project that you didn’t want in the first place. It can also be heartbreaking if your treasured personal items reach the soggy, beyond-repair stage. Check these items regularly:

                                    Sump pump: Make sure it is working properly. A battery backup that kicks in during a power outage serves as good insurance against disaster and is a much cheaper alternative to a flooded basement.

                                    Water softeners: Make sure the water softener is in good repair and not likely to leak.

                                    Landscape grading: Check the plants and grading around the house to make sure water will flow away from the house rather than toward the foundation or window wells. If the ground is perfected leveled, it can become a virtual moat filled with water after heavy rains. This can end in seepage or flooding through cracks and windows.
